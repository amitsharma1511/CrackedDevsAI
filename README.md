## Inspiration

While we do see many job descriptions and always ask ourselves that am I ready, can someone take a mock interview or is there something I must learn to apply for the specific job.

## What it does

Get ready to unleash the power of AI while applying for jobs. The solution proposed here is aimed towards making candidates prepare for the interview with questions or if they feel currently they are not up to the mark to apply for the particular job they can get a structured learning path recommendation for the preparation.

## How I built it

This has been built using crackeddevs API and google gemini pro model using react JS.

## What's next for CrackedDevs with Power of AI

This can also be further extended with features like when a candidate uploads resume, the AI can match it with job description and provide a constructive feedback by comparing the skills with job description.
Also can be used to search jobs based on skills extracted from resume.
